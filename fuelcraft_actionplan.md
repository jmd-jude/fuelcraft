**Success Metric:** 3+ kit testers report positive experience
**Decision:** Proceed with sourcing or redesign kits

### End of Week 3:
**Question:** Are the economics viable at small scale?
**Success Metric:** Can achieve 50%+ gross margin at 50-unit batch size
**Decision:** Launch soft sale or find better sourcing

### End of Week 4:
