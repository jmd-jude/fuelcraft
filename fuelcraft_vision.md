# FuelCraft: Company & Product Vision Document

*Last Updated: August 2025*

## Executive Summary

FuelCraft democratizes high-performance sports nutrition by providing endurance athletes with specialized ingredients and the knowledge to create customized fuel.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Market Reality

- **DIY alternatives require chemistry knowledge** and significant research to use safely and effectively
- **No educational bridge exists** between expensive convenience and bulk ingredient complexity

### Market Gap
